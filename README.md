# From Zero to AI Hero ft AWS SageMaker 

## Introduction

This workshop is created for Connect NYC Women Who Code Conference in New York. 

Getting started in AI is so much fun - but what if you want to take your idea further? What if you want to release your project to the world to use?

In this session we are going to show you how to take the machine learning model from your laptop into a production environment - so that it could be used by millions of users all over the world with AWS SageMaker.

With AI now integrated into the solutions we create, it has presented us with many issues when it comes to deployment, mostly due to the size of the models generated - so other traditional deployment methods donâ€™t work. Throughout this workshop we will be creating a model and putting it on SageMaker to train with more data, we will then move onto deploying the model to be public facing and demonstrate how a user could consume the API to receive predictions.

The agenda of this workship is as follows:
1. Creating S3 bucket
2. SageMaker Service
3. Create Notebook Instance
4. Clone Project to Notebook Instance
5. Data Cleaning and Splitting 

### SageMaker 

AI, ML Engineers and Data Scientists need to know more than a Jupyter notebook to delivering production AI services and integrate it with portal or basic web/mobile applications in a flexible and realiable way. SageMaker is a fully managed  cloud based machine learning service. You can:

- **Build** - SageMaker has managed jupyter Notebook  environment and comes with an extensive collection of popular ML algorithms that are optimized for AWS cloud 
- **Train** - It is a managed training infrastructure. Training on SageMaker is scable and it can distruibte training across one or many instances 
- **Deploy** - Scalable hosting infrastructure. Users can do real time predictions or batch transformations

## Pre-Requisites

In order to complete the workshop, you'll need an AWS account and full permissions to S3 and SageMaker. 

Basic experience (not mandatory) 
- Train/Test ML Models
- Python (scikit-learn)
- Create an account [Link]
Can take 24 hours for it to be activated

In order to complete this workshop you'll need an AWS Account with access to SageMaker and S3. There are resources required by this workshop that are eligible for the AWS free tier if your account is less than 12 months old. 
Check out the the [AWS Free Tier](https://aws.amazon.com/free/?all-free-tier.sort-by=item.additionalFields.SortRank&all-free-tier.sort-order=asc) page for more details.

AWS Credits will be provided on the day. 

## AWS Region

Once you pick which region to use, make sure you use the same region for all servies. Not all regions work with SageMaker so for this workshop and location of this workshop during the time of this workshop, we recommend using **US East (Ohio) Region.** 

For more information about regions, please [click here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/instance-types-az.html) 

## 1. Create S3 bucket

Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service) is an object storage service that offers industry-leading scalability, data availability, security, and performance. SageMaker uses S3 to store data and model artifacts. 

To begin using S3, sign into the management console

1. Find the [S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) Service from the management console
2. Click on **+Create Bucket** 
3. Provide a name for your bucket (This must be a globally unique name)
4. Select Region, make sure you use the same one thoughout this workshop
5. Click **Create**
6. Your bucket should then appear

You can now see that your bucket has been created. You can set many configurations and permissions for your bucket. S3 provides easy to use management features so you can organise your data and configure finely-tuned access controls to meet your specific business, organizational needs. 

## 2. SageMaker 

Navigate back to AWS management services and search for SageMaker, click on this and it will navigate you to the SageMaker console. 

**Note: Make sure you are in the correct region**

As you can see from first glance, SageMaker provides many features. The first page it takes you to us a dashboard that shows the user an overview and recent activity. On the left hand side you will see a menu with many different SageMaker features such as labeling, notebook, training and inference. 

### 3. Create Notebook Instance

1. First we want to create a notebook instance, navigate to this option on the menu 
2. At the top right, click **Create Notebook Instance**

![alt text](https://github.com/womenwhocode-belfast/SageMakerWorkshop/blob/master/Images/CreateNotebook.png "Logo Title Text 1")

3. Provide the instane name and type. E.g. wwcode-smworkshop and select ml.t2.medium [instance](https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/pricing/instance-types/)

![alt text](https://github.com/womenwhocode-belfast/SageMakerWorkshop/blob/master/Images/Notebook_Name.png "Logo Title Text 1")

4. For Permissions and encryption, select **create a new role** in the IAM role dropdown menu. In the pop-up modal, select Specific S3 buckets and type in the name of your bucket and a comma followed by gdelt-open-data and then click 'create role'.

5. After this, you should be navigated back to the create notebook instance page and you should see a green box saying 'success....'

6. Select **Enable**, to give users root access to the notebook. 
7. Click **Create Notebook Instance**

There are many other optional features that you can set up such as VPC, Tags and Git Repo. For this tutorial, we will be cloning the git repo in the notebook instance terminal. 

After the notebook is created, you will be navigated back to the notebook instance page and you will see a green box saying 'success'

8. Wait for the server status to change to **InService**. This may take several minutes.
9. Click **Open Jupyter**, You will now see the Jupyter homepage for your notebook instance.


### 4. Clone Project to Notebook Instance

1. On the Jupyter notebook homepage at the top right, click on **New** which will open a dropdown menu. Click **Terminal**. This will then open a Jupyter Notebook Terminal!
2. Type [CD] **git clone https://github.com/womenwhocode-belfast/SageMakerWorkshop.git** to clone this project into jupyter notebook. 

There is another way to do this [..] 

For this workshop, we are using the breast cancer dataset. 

## 5. Data Cleaning and Splitting

We need to split our data into a train, valdiation set and test. 
The training dataset is the sample of data used to fit the model. The Validation Dataset is the sample of data used to provide an unbiased evaluation of a model fit on the training dataset while tuning model hyperparameters. The Test Dataset is the sample of data used to provide an unbiased evaluation of a final model fit on the training dataset.

Our data then needs to be put in an S3 bucket so that our algorithm can use it!

To find out more about how we did this, go to Jupyter Notebook, open file **[..]** 

## 6. Training  

Data is pre-processed for you already in this workshop and we have split it into three files: 
1. training.csv
2. validation.csv
3. test.csv

For the training part of this workshop, open Jupyter Notebook and open file **[]**

## 7. Deploy Model

After you build and train your model, the next step is to deploy the model to get predictions. Specify the number of instances, type of instance and endpoint name. Once endpoint is ready, you can run predictions on it.

## 8. Run Predictions against endpoint
